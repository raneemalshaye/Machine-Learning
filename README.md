### Overview
This project aims to perform comprehensive data analysis on the Iris dataset. We apply various machine learning techniques to understand the dataset thoroughly, including data preprocessing, visualization, clustering, outlier detection, supervised learning, and model tuning.

### Features
Data Preprocessing: Initial setup, data loading from UCI repository, and preliminary data exploration.
Data Visualization: Using seaborn and matplotlib for insights into the dataset.
Unsupervised Learning: Applying K-means clustering and visualizing the clusters to understand the data distribution.
Supervised Learning: Implementing and evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Tuning and Ensemble: Tuning the best model using grid search and comparing ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
